Description
===========

This plugin gives access to a new data source called `KairosDB`.

It allows you to build queries for `KairosDB`.
A query is the operation that fetches data from the database, executes some processing (aggregation,..), and returns the result in the form of time series. 

For more information about queries and Grafana please refer to the official Grafana documentation.
